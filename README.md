# Introduction
This is a custom component  that enables communication with a Ziggo Mediabox Next within Home Assistant.

![Example of using the Mediabox Next](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IIStevowII/ziggo-mediabox-next/master/screenshot.PNG)

# Installation
During early development it is only possible to install this component manually.

## Manual installation
1) Download the content of this repository

2) Place the directory "ziggo-mediabox-next" in the "custom_components" directory of your Home Assistant installation.

3) A restart of Home Assistant is required before the component will work.

# Usage
Inside your configuration.yaml add the following lines:
```yaml
media_player:
  - platform: ziggo-mediabox-next
    username: !secret ziggo_username
    password: !secret ziggo_password
```

The username and password need to correspond with the credentials used to login on mijn.ziggo.nl or the Ziggo app.
It is highly recommend to use secrets for these values, as you definitely not want these credentials to become public. These credentials will ONLY be used to retrieve a special token, which is used for communication with the Ziggo Mediabox Next.

## Current features
- Start / stop the device
- Play / pause the screen
- Previous / next channel
- Switch to a specific channel
- Display the current channel name including a snapshot*

* It is not yet possible to retrieve the current channel, so this will only work with channels that are set using this component

## Future (possible) features
- [ ] Read status on succesful connection (current channel, volume etc.)
- [ ] Retrieve status updates when using the remote
- [ ] Change the volume (up/down & mute/unmute)
- [ ] Switch channel using numeric input
- [ ] Recording (of a specific channel and time)
- [ ] Start apps

# About
This component is developed after retrieving a Ziggo Mediabox Next and getting into Home Assistant.
It is my first python project and also my first Home Assistant component integration.

It is not under active development, but feedback and additional functionality are always welcome.
Unfortunately untill additional MQTT commands are discoverd, it is not possible to implement certain functionality.

## Credits
This entire component is based on a proof of concept published here: https://github.com/basst85/NextRemoteJs/

Ziggo Mediabox XL used for certain development choices: https://github.com/b10m/ziggo_mediabox_xl/

And ofcourse various other (media player) components which I've used as a reference guide.
